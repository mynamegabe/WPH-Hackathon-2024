## Brief Explanation of Solution
With the increasing speed of advancements in the field of artificial intelligence, the availability of AI applications and services to the general public has been growing. With access to these tools, job applicants are able to generate content for the resumes, interview questions, form responses and more, blurring the lines between the truly exceptional applicants and the rest.

JobStop aims to combat this phenomenon. JobStop is an AI-enhanced human resourcing platform that incorporates artificial intelligence technologies to provide AI content detection, human traits/characteristic extrapolation, job matching and more. 

By detecting the usage of artificial intelligence, employers are given more visibility on their applicants. Combined with other AI capabilities, the platform matches applicants with job roles, providing a layer of semantic analysis before applications reach human resources.
